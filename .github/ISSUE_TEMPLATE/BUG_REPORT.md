This template is here to help you submit an issue.

It is meant to guide you towards creating a meaningful report, so that the maintainers of `pytest-monitor` have all the information they need to address your problem in a swift and efficient manner.
Please read carefully each of the sections below, and adapt the text depending on the type of issue you are reporting.

Github uses [Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github) to render issues: you can edit this very text here, and then see a preview of how it renders by switching to the *Preview* tab just above this panel.
Do not hesitate to use the full extent of [Markdown formatting][markdown_formatting] to make your issue submission more clear and explicit.

If all is clear, you may delete this section and start with your submission.
